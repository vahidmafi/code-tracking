# Code Tracking Repository

This repository contains code activity tracking data.

## What is this?

This repository is automatically maintained by the VS Code Code Tracking extension. It records coding activity and commits it periodically, allowing you to:

- Review coding patterns
- Track time spent on different projects
- Monitor coding activity over time

The data is automatically updated every 5 minutes (configurable in VS Code settings).

## Repository Structure

- Each commit represents a snapshot of coding activity
- Commit messages contain summaries of what changed
- The data is organized chronologically
